COMPILE: javac *.java

USAGE:

1. run server first: java FileServer
2. create a file to be copied if you don't have one: java FileCreate filename file-size
3. run the client to transfer the file: java FileClient server-address port filename [seconds]

-> while localhost testing place the server and the client into different folders so you can see the file being actually copied.

-> specify the seconds parameter in the client arguments in order to simulate work.

-> run both server and client into separate terminals.
